cd comparator
npm install && npm run dev
```

## Tools used
- Typescript 
- Tailwind
- shadcn for components
- [Magic](https://magicui.design/) for the Sparkles
- Inspiration from [Aceternity](https://ui.aceternity.com/components/3d-pin) for the animated blockquotes

Other tools I'm probably forgetting to shout-out.
